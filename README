This is the repository for the input financial data.

The operating system is Linux Mint Debian Edition with GNOME.

Note that Doppler Value Investing standardizes around the *.csv format.

You can open these files through LibreOffice Calc.  The only options you need to change are the separator options.  Select separated by comma.

The format of the input financial data files:
*  Column 1: name of the line items
*  Column 2: the specific category that the line item of Column 1 fits under
*  Row 1: the year, with the most recent year first
*  Row 2: split factor
*  Row 3: units of the financial data for all "plus" line items
*  Row 4: units of the financial data for all "minus" line items (only necessary if minority interest is a factor)
*  All other rows and columns contain the financial data of a given line item and year
